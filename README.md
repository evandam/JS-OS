A JavaScript based operating system utilizing the HTML5 Canvas and local storage,
including hardware simulations of a CPU, memory, and disk storage.

This project implements multiple CPU scheduling algorithms, multiprocessing, swapping, and a file system.

Single-step debugging can be used while running a program to advance one instruction at a time.
